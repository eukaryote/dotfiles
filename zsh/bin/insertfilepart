# Given a file as arg 1 (just name or full path) and an
# 'extra' string as arg2, insert the extra string into
# the filename (adding an extra '.') before the extension
# if there is one, or at the end if there is not.

# Examples:
#   $ insertfilepart foo.bar.txt extra
#   foo.bar.extra.txt
#   $ insertfilepart foo extra
#   foo.extra
